<p>#How to use Needleman Wunsch to Align DNA Sequences</p>
<p>#By Hand</p>
<p>Lets say you want to align the sequences CCAGT and ACAAGT using a match score of 2, mismatch score of -1 and a gap score of -1. You would first begin aligning the sequences by making a 6 x 7 grid including a gap column/row in front of each of the sequences. From there, you move horizontally and vertically accross the chart adding and subtracting the appropriate value for a match (+2), mismatch(-1), or gap(-1) in the sequence. Keep the value that is the lowerst possible for each cell in the table. For instance, starting from 0 in the upper right corner, each movement is a gap or a mismatch, so you subtract 1 from 0.</p>
<p>See the completed chart below:

<p>From there, you can backtrace from the largest bottom right cell to the upper left cell following the highest numbers to lowest. The backtrace in this case should sum to 6 with the aligned sequences “ACAAGT” and “-CCAGT”.</p>
<p>#In Python
A much easier method of aligning the sequence is making a formula in python that should return the same matrix as above:</p>
<p>s1=“ACAAGT”
s2=“CCAGT”</p>
<p>def match_fun(a,b): # Helper function to define match/mismatch scores<br />
if a==b:<br />
score=1<br />
else:<br />
score=-1<br />
return score</p>
<p>def needleman(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1, match_score=2, mismatch_score=-1):<br />
m=len(seq1)<br />
n=len(seq2)<br />
score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1])<br />
for j in range(0, m + 1): score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j<br />
for i in range(0, n + 1): score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i<br />
for i in range(1, n + 1):<br />
for j in range(1, m + 1):<br />
insert = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty<br />
delete = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty<br />
match = score[i - 1][j - 1]+match_fun(seq1[j-1],-seq2[i-1])<br />
score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
return score</p>
