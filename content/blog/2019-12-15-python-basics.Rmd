#How to use Needleman Wunsch to Align DNA Sequences

#By Hand

Lets say you want to align the sequences CCAGT and ACAAGT using a match score of 2, mismatch score of -1 and a gap score of -1. You would first begin aligning the sequences by making a 6 x 7 grid including a gap column/row in front of each of the sequences. From there, you move horizontally and vertically accross the chart adding and subtracting the appropriate value for a match (+2), mismatch(-1), or gap(-1) in the sequence. Keep the value that is the lowerst possible for each cell in the table. For instance, starting from 0 in the upper right corner, each movement is a gap or a mismatch, so you subtract 1 from 0.

See the completed chart below:

From there, you can backtrace from the largest bottom right cell to the upper left cell following the highest numbers to lowest. The backtrace in this case should sum to 6 with the aligned sequences "ACAAGT" and "-CCAGT".

#In Python
A much easier method of aligning the sequence is making a formula in python that should return the same matrix as above:

s1="ACAAGT"
s2="CCAGT"

def match_fun(a,b):  # Helper function to define match/mismatch scores    
  if a==b:        
    score=1    
  else:        
    score=-1   
  return score

def needleman(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1, match_score=2, mismatch_score=-1):    
  m=len(seq1)  
  n=len(seq2)   
  score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1])   
  for j in range(0, m + 1): score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j    
  for i in range(0, n + 1): score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i    
  for i in range(1, n + 1):         
    for j in range(1, m + 1):            
      insert = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty             
      delete = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty             
      match = score[i - 1][j - 1]+match_fun(seq1[j-1],-seq2[i-1])            
      score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
  return score
